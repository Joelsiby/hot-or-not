              Outbid is a public leaderboard. There are no ads, no API keys, and no revenue share. 
              You pay to stand above everyone else. Rank is the bid — nothing else.
            </p>
            <p>
              The concept is simple: place a bid, get a rank. The higher your bid, the higher your rank. 
              If someone outbids you, you can pay the difference to reclaim your spot.

              This project was built as a simple side project to explore the concept of paid rankings 
              and real-time leaderboards.
